2. How to play the game
    press 'enter' at the start screen, which displays the general game info-panel
    then select the player using the arrow keys and hit enter to start playing
    the goal of the game is to gather 200 points before 60 seconds have elapsed
    the player can move left right down or up and must avoid the bugs

    reaching the waterline yields 10 points
    gathering gems yield:
        blue gem   80 points
        green gem  50 points
        orange gem 30 points

    if you lose all 3 lives or do not gather 200 points before the 60 seconds have elapsed,
    the game is lost and you can hit enter to play again

    if you win the game, a panel is displayed with a winner message and the time used to finish the game
    and you can hit enter to play again

GOOD LUCK!
